  <h1>American Beeswax vs. Imported: Why the Source Matters</h1>
  <p class="blog-meta">Beeswax Pat &nbsp;·&nbsp; February 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; 5 min read</p>

  <p>
    Most people don't think about where beeswax comes from. It's wax from bees —
    how different can it be? It turns out: meaningfully different, depending on sourcing,
    oversight, and what ends up mixed into the raw wax before it reaches candle makers.
    Here's what the research shows and why we source exclusively American beeswax.
  </p>

  <h2>Where Most Commercial Beeswax Comes From</h2>
  <p>
    China is the world's largest producer and exporter of beeswax. A significant portion
    of commercial beeswax used in candle-making, cosmetics, and food processing globally
    is Chinese-origin wax. This isn't inherently a problem — but it has created documented
    quality control issues at scale.
  </p>

  <h2>The Adulteration Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Multiple peer-reviewed studies in food science and agricultural chemistry journals
    have identified adulteration of commercial beeswax — particularly in exported Chinese
    wax. The most common adulterant found is paraffin, mixed into the beeswax at the
    raw processing stage, before it reaches importers or candle manufacturers.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Adulteration happens upstream — at the raw wax level — meaning candle makers
      who purchase imported wax may not know their "beeswax" already contains paraffin
      before they even start pouring.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This creates a situation where a candle maker might genuinely believe they're
    using 100% beeswax — because that's what they purchased — when the raw material
    was already adulterated before they received it. It's a supply chain problem,
    not necessarily a deception by the candle maker themselves. But it still ends up
    in your candle.
  </p>

  <h2>American Beekeeping and Oversight</h2>
  <p>
    American beekeeping operates under USDA oversight and domestic agricultural standards.
    American beeswax producers — typically individual or small commercial beekeepers —
    are subject to those standards in a way that large-volume overseas exporters are not.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we purchase beeswax from American sources, we can verify origin more directly.
    The supply chain is shorter. The producers are accountable to domestic standards.
    The risk of undisclosed adulteration at the raw material stage is significantly lower.
  </p>

  <h2>Supporting American Beekeeping</h2>
  <p>
    There's a practical reason to care about American beekeeping beyond wax quality.
    Honeybees pollinate approximately one-third of the U.S. food supply. American bee
    populations have faced serious pressure over the past two decades from colony
    collapse disorder, pesticide exposure, habitat loss, and disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    Supporting American beekeepers — including through purchasing American-sourced
    beeswax rather than cheaper imported alternatives — is one way consumers can
    contribute to domestic pollinator health. It's not the only factor, but it's a
    real one.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're not lecturing here. We source American beeswax because it's better for
    our product and better for traceability. The pollinator angle is a genuine bonus.
  </p>

  <h2>What "Organic" Means for Beeswax</h2>
  <p>
    Certified organic beeswax means the bees that produced it foraged from organic
    sources and were managed without prohibited pesticides or antibiotics. It's a
    higher standard than conventional beeswax, and the certification requires third-party
    verification. Our wax is certified organic American beeswax.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can't verify "organic" claims on imported wax with the same confidence —
    organic certification from overseas suppliers is harder to audit and enforce.
    American-certified organic beeswax comes with a paper trail.
  </p>

  <h2>What This Means for Our Candles</h2>
  <p>
    When we say "100% organic American beeswax," we mean:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>American sourced.</strong> Not imported. Not from a supplier who imports
    and repackages. From U.S. beekeepers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Certified organic.</strong> Third-party verified, not a marketing label.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No downstream blending.</strong> We pour beeswax into jars.
    That's the process. No paraffin added, no blending step, no shortcuts.
